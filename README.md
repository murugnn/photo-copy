### Project Description

Snap a selfie and let our app find your zany celebrity doppelganger from a wild database of famous faces‚Äîemotions and weird surprises guaranteed! Whether you get your lookalike or a totally unexpected match, it‚Äôs all about pointless fun and sharing laughs with friends. Everyone gets a twin‚Äîeven if it makes no sense!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

We‚Äôre solving the age-old dilemma of not knowing which random celebrity (or object!) you sort of, kind of, barely resemble in the silliest way possible. Our app matches your selfie to a ‚Äúdoppelganger‚Äù for no reason at all‚Äîremoving any actual sense of purpose, but adding heaps of laughter and absurdity to your day. Because the world clearly needed a pointless way to discover your totally useless twin!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We‚Äôre tackling the world‚Äôs most pointless identity crisis with the power of AI and a database full of celebrity faces! Just upload your selfie, and our app launches into action‚Äîscanning pixels, making wild guesses, and matching you with your absurdly unexpected lookalike. It‚Äôs technical wizardry with zero real-world benefit, designed only to spark surprise, laughter, and maybe a little confusion. Because sometimes, you don‚Äôt need a real solution‚Äîjust a really silly one!
